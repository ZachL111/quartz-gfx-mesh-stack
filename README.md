# quartz-gfx-mesh-stack

`quartz-gfx-mesh-stack` is a focused Dart codebase around design a Dart verification harness for mesh systems, covering policy evaluation, deny and allow fixtures, and failure-oriented tests. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Quartz Gfx Mesh Stack Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the graphics idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## Capabilities

- Includes extended examples for render inputs, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents stable output tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Reason For The Project

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## Where Things Live

- `lib`: library code
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## How It Is Put Together

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying graphics behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Dart project uses a small library and assertion script, avoiding package dependencies for verification.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Data Notes

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Tradeoffs

This code is local-first. It makes no claim about deployed usage and avoids credentials, hosted state, and environment-specific setup.

## Possible Extensions

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more graphics fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Getting It Running

Use a normal shell with Dart available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.
